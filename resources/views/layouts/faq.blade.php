                        We have a total of 18 colors to choose from. 8 of these are white when the sign is turned off and colored when the sign is switched on. The remaining ten colors come with a colored tube, so the sign shows its color even when it's turned off.

                        We have developed our own range of 36 fonts, including cursive, block and double lined fonts. In addition to being unique to LedProject, ours is the most extensive selection offered by an LED neon sign maker. What's even better is that we can work with almost any font, character set, or writing style. If the LedProject fonts on our neon sign maker (click the font tab) aren't quite what you're after let us know what you need and we'll make it happen!

Our outdoor signage range is made using high quality LED lights in fully enclosed acrylic, and they have an IP67 Waterproof rating.

                        Our signs come with an acrylic backboard. You can choose from a variety of options when it comes to this backboard (sometimes the design will determine what backboard is required). The backboard can be cut around the shape so it is contoured and nearly invisible or it can be cut in a desired shape. The backboard color can be clear, metalic, a solid color or UV printed with an image.

                            Most LedProject products come with a 4.9ft transparent cord which plugs into a US certified AC adapter. The adapter has an additional 3-6ft of black cable that plugs into the socket. A free remote & dimmer will automatically be added to your order at checkout.

                            Hanging your new neon light sign is surprisingly easy.  LedProject signs weigh 6-11lb on average and include pre-drilled holes on the acrylic backboard.  LedProject signs are safe to transport and easy to install.

                            For wall mounting your new neon light you’ll need one of our Wall Mounting kits which must be purchased at the time of ordering your sign as they require a specific hole size. To hang the sign you'll need one of our Sign Hanging kits or you can also do it yourself with hardware store items:

                            If your custom order is for a sign larger than 7ft 8in by 3ft 11in it will be made on two or more backboards that can be easily arranged together.
